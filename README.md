# pylambdaopt

Python code and scripts to optimize lambda values in FEP calculations

* `A16F_relative/`  - Simulation files for the A16F alchemical transformation of the A8 miniprotin.  Also contains results of unoptimized and optimized EE simulations that were analyzed in the manuscript.
* `biceps_xi_optimization`
* `examples` - **working examples of how to use the pylambdaopt scripts**
* `figures` - an incomplete collection of figures generated for the manuscript
* `scripts` - **code and command-line tools to optimize alchemical intermediates**
* `toy_model` - code and scripts to performing EE sampling and analysis of the toy 1D harmonic potential system discussed in the manuscript.
