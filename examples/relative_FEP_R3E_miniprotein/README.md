## Description 

These are GROMACS .mdp and dhdl.xvg files for a R3E (Arg --> Glu) relative FEP transformation
of miniprotein A8 in solution.

This topology is particular challenging, because the Arginine (+1 charge) is transformed to a Glutamic acid (-1 charge). Electoneutrality is maintained by simultaneously transforming two Cl- ions (molecule type CLZ) to an uncharged version.

Originally simulated on Folding@home: PROJ18460, RUN29
